        <h2>Know the dangers of the internet</h2>
        <p>Internet is a very useful tool. But as everything has its own advantages and disadvantages, internet has also disadvantages. So make sure you know the dangers of the internet to protect yourself from any cybercrime. After all precaution is better than cure.</p>
        <h2>Use strong and unique passwords</h2>
        <p>Don't use the same password over all the websites and apps. If a hacker succeed in gaining the password of one of your accounts then he/she will easily break through your all accounts. Always use password that has a mixture of letters, numbers and symbols because a password of this type is very hard to guess or breakthrough.</p>
        <h2>Only use websites that is served via HTTPS</h2>
        <p>HTTPS enforces the encryption of the data sent between the server and the client so no other person can see the data that is being sent between you and the server.</p>
        <h2>Don't use public Wi-Fi</h2>
        <p>You should not use public Wi-Fi especially if you are dealing with sensitive data because the Wi-Fi provider (attacker) can see the data sent between you and the server, this attack is commonly know as man-in-the-middle attack.</p>
        <h2>Use VPN</h2>
        <p>A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is an encrypted connection over the Internet from a device to a network. The encrypted connection helps ensure that data is safely transmitted, and it also helps you in masking you IP address, so you are not trackable by anyone on the internet.</p>
        <h2>Use trusted sources for downloading</h2>
        <p>Using untrusted sources for downloading can lead to many problems like you might download a file that contains malware. So always use trusted sources for downloading anything online, like to download android apps use Google Play Store.</p>
        <h2>Don't open attachments received from unknown emails</h2>
        <p>Email attachments can contain malicious files. If you don't know the sender or the email is not trustworthy then don't open or download the email attachments.</p>
        <h2>Clear your browser cookies</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small blocks of data that can be placed by websites in your browser. Although it has legitimate use cases, but it can also be used to track you on the internet. So clear your browser cookies frequently.</p>
        <h2>Don't share sensitive information</h2>
        <p>On internet many people ends up sharing their information like emails, passwords, bank account details. And this could lead you to many problems, from spams to financial problems. Try to not share sensitive information as much as possible.</p>
